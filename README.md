# 🏡 Boston Housing Price Prediction

This project uses linear regression to predict housing prices in Boston based on various features.

## 📦 Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Features: 13 (e.g., crime rate, number of rooms, tax rate)
- Target: Median value of owner-occupied homes

## 📊 Workflow
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Training (Linear Regression)
4. Evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R²)

## 📁 Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and modeling
- `src/`: Python scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/train_model.py
